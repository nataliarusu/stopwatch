### About stopwatch
- Time is displayed in the format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
- "Start" button: starts or continues the timer.
- After the timer starts, the "Start" button functions as the "Pause" button.
- "Reset" button: resets the timer to zero and clears all laps.
- "Lap" button: writes the time in the lap list (this does not stop the timer). As soon as the user presses the lap button, the lap timer resets to 00:00:00:00. This feature allows the user to see the elapsed time since the last lap and the timer's current laps time. Both results are displayed on the screen and are still visible if the page is refreshed.
- "Clear lap" button: clears any lap history
